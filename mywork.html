      <p>In Narrative & New Media class, out team was in charge of developing an narrative that would be displayed on a website that a user could interact with. I was involved in the early stages of the process for this project as I contributed in creating a meaningful story. I was mainly in charge of the storyboard and creating the graphics for the story as we decided that our story would have comic book-like visuals.</p>

    <p>In SIAT's 3D Animation course, my team had to create a 3D animated short film based on an existing or an original story with the help of MAYA, a 3D Animation software. For this project, we had to carefully follow the different stages of creating a short film, that is, pre-production, production and post-production. I was in charge of the storyboard stage, where conceptual ideas turn into concrete ideas. I was also involved in modelling, rigging and animating different scenes.</p>
    <p>Characters are one of the most important elements of an animation film. In my sketches, I intend to portray the overall look and personality of the character that will be reflected in the final film. After designing the character, my duty was to illustrate how every scene, from the exposition stage to the resolution, would unfold. I try to incorporate as many emotions as possible, with a variety of shots, ranging from close-ups to long shots, to provide dynamism to the storyboard.The main issues we encountered was time management. With a deadlie to respect, every member's role was interchained. As a result, the team took decisions together which helped the project to not only be completed on time, but also have a uniform flow, which was reflected in the final piece.</p>
