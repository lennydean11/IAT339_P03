        <h1>George</h1>
      <p>In Narrative & New Media class, our team was in charge of developing an narrative that would be displayed on a website that a user could interact with. I was involved in the early stages of the process for this project as I contributed in creating a meaningful story. I was mainly in charge of the storyboard and creating the graphics for the story as we decided that our story would have comic book-like visuals.</p>
      <p>Our story takes place in a small town called Sherwood where two long-time friends are on the verge of parting ways due to the current environmental situation of the town. George, who is secretly in love with Elizabeth tries to make her stay by taking action and pushing the people of Sherwood to save their town. With this project, we wanted to not only inform users about the environmental state of our planet but use the platform to make users interact with the story by making their own choices to influence the ending. The Website allowd us to have buttons which would guide users to different scenes depending on their choices. In order to achieve this, our team had to carefully think of our intentions while designing different scenarios that would convey different messages. On top of the illustrations, I had the task of creating one scenario of the 4 scenarios that would tak the story forward. </p>

      <h1>Harold's Toy</h1>
    <p>In SIAT's 3D Animation course, my team had to create a 3D animated short film based on an existing or an original story with the help of MAYA, a 3D Animation software. For this project, we had to carefully follow the different stages of creating a short film, that is, pre-production, production and post-production. I was in charge of the storyboard stage, where conceptual ideas turn into concrete ideas. I was also involved in modelling, rigging and animating different scenes.</p>
    <p>Characters are one of the most important elements of an animation film. In my sketches, I intend to portray the overall look and personality of the character that will be reflected in the final film. After designing the character, my duty was to illustrate how every scene, from the exposition stage to the resolution, would unfold. I try to incorporate as many emotions as possible, with a variety of shots, ranging from close-ups to long shots, to provide dynamism to the storyboard and the film. The main issues we encountered was time management. With a deadline to respect, every member's role was interchained. As a result, the team took decisions together which helped the project to not only be completed on time, but also have a uniform flow, which was reflected in the final piece.</p>
