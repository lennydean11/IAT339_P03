      <p>As an international student, I was initially here to study Graphic Design but I find myself more comfortable crafting projects in the Media concentration of SFU's Interactive Arts and Technology program. With sketching and drawing being embedded in my DNA and being obsessed with portraits, I am captivated by the complexity of the human body, specifically the face and its emotions, which pushes me to be as detail-orientated as possible in my work. I nurture a growing interest in Film and 3D Animation where my sketching skills can be conveniently used.</p>

    <p>Since I thrive to be a 3D Animator or Storyboard artist, Pixar would be the main goal but more realistically here, companies like <a href="http://www.bluechipproductions.ca/">Blue Chip Production</a> and <a href="http://www.bigbadboo.com">Big Bad Boo</a> would be potential employers. A storyboard artist position would be interesting for me.For this position, I would assume that sketching skills, drawing and editing graphics on software are essential but also teamwork and communication.They are looking for someone with a degree or diploma in arts or equivalent as well as a full portfolio of sample work. Also, the ability to work under strict deadlines, having strong ethics and being a team player are important.The employers describe themselves as a distributor of high quality, entertaining and inclusive content.Pixar describe themselves as proud of their tradition of creative and technical excellence with the goal of making great films with great people.
